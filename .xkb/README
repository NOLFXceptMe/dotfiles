AFAIK there is no way to have more than one rules file, so using the files
under rules/ seems impossible without fully duplicating the default rule
(evdev):

% setxkbmap -query
rules:      evdev
model:      pc105
layout:     us

To reset to a standard layout, use:

% setxkbmap -layout us -option

Existing rules can be found in: /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst

To add the ctrl:nocaps and nate:lctrl_super rules, use:

setxkbmap -print | sed -e '/xkb_symbols/ s/"\(.*\)"/"\1+ctrl(nocaps)+nate(lctrl_super)"/' | xkbcomp -I$HOME/.xkb - $DISPLAY 2>/dev/null
